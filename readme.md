Page scroll to id
=========================

Page scroll to id is an easy-to-use jQuery plugin that enables animated page scrolling to specific id within the document. 
The plugin replaces the default browser behaviour of "jumping" to page sections when links with href value containing `#` are clicked, by smoothly animating the page to those sections ([see demo](http://manos.malihu.gr/repository/page-scroll-to-id/demo/demo.html)). Features include: 

* Auto-adjustable animation speed 
* Advanced animation easings 
* Vertical and/or horizontal scrolling 
* Links and targets highlighting via ready-to-use classes 
* Auto-adjustable Scroll-to position and user defined offset 

#### Usage 

`$("a[href*='#']").mPageScroll2id();`
